## ✅ Website Submission Guidelines

1. **The website must be deployed online** — no `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
2. The link must use **`https://`**.
3. **No duplicates allowed** — each site should be unique.
4. The website must be **accessible** (i.e., not broken or offline).
5. All fields in your YAML entry must be **correct and complete**.

Example format (in `sites.yaml`):

```yaml
sites:
